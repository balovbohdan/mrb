I’m a software engineer who likes diving deep into technical topics and sharing his knowledge. Usually, I like talking about hands-on software architecture and system design. However, sometimes I can share my experience with practical things like front-end frameworks or development techniques.

Genuinely speaking, I write my papers for myself. They allow me to deepen my understanding of tough subjects. On the other hand, the general public can benefit from this by revisiting technical information quickly without the need to read a thick book or take a time-consuming course.

## My Journey

Thanks to my grandpa, I started my engineering journey early. The environment indeed shapes you. Grown in a family of old-school engineers, I was surrounded by different kinds of inventions every day, the main purpose of what was to make our poor existence smarter. Resistors and transistors were here and there, and an acidic smell of soldering iron was impossible to blow out.

When my grandpa had gone, I was mentally lost for several years. When you are a child and you lose a close relative, you lose your pathway. Aeromodelism and an appropriate environment of young inventors helped me to recover.

Then, the computer appeared in my home. After some time, I have got a slow internet connection. It was a revolution for my brain. I remember that first search request — it was about plane model sketches. I was rapidly involved in a computer community that was mainly comprised of nerdy teenagers: instead of playing football, we were playing computer games and dreaming about being game developers one day in our adult lives.

To make my dreams a reality, I started experimenting with 3D modeling (I used 3D Max) and learning my first programming language — Delphi (as I understood later, It was a mistake, and I’d better choose C).

For some reason, that I can't remember, I halted my idea of being a game developer. In preparing for the university exams, my main goal was to receive as high marks as possible, and game development or anything else was not important at all. In my second year at the university, there was an impulse that led me to computers again: I tried to solve as many problems as possible using modern digital solutions when it was appropriate or allowed. In the third year, I had my first commercial web development project with a gang of local hackers. Because of several reasons, I was involved in the project more like a manager rather than an engineer. Those were strange times of looking for my pathway.

After a series of personal and group projects, that were far from successful, I became a web development freelancer, which allowed me to earn some money, gain some experience, and graduate without debts.

After the graduation in 2017, I’m working as a full-time software engineer. Since that time, I tried different domains and technologies. My most successful assignments were mostly about the front-end.  However, I try to not stick to a specific field and develop myself as a flexible software engineer ready to tackle complex and end-to-end problems.

It was a long journey, that made me the person I’m now: father, engineer, athlete, and survivor…

You are welcome to know my thoughts and ideas on technical problems I work on.
